## Overview
This is our final project for Advanced Full-Stack Software Development in JavaScript.

## Deployment
We are deployed on Firebase <br/>
[What's Cookin'](https://whatscookin-4fd17.web.app/)

## Web Application
This web application consiss of a frontend written in React Redux, and Material UI. The backend was written in JavaScript, with a SQL database.

Have you ever been both hungry any lonely, but you don't know what to make or have anyone to talk to? Well now you have What's Cookin! A social network interface is proveided where you can create a profile, post your own new recipes, view existing recipes, and even search for recipes by ingredients you already have in your fridge to share (the recipe not your food)! If you find a recipe you love, save it to your very own cookbook to go back and look at whenever you are hungry! 

## Tools Used

* React
* Redux
* Axios
* Prisma
* SQLite
* Node.js

## Usage


## Approach to Testing
In this application we are utilizing a testing library called `jest`. We have automated unit and integration tests for the current state of this application.
- `NOTE:` Anything you change / add on this application may or may not break these tests and that is the risk you have to take.
Currently this application is configured to run the following command
```bash
$ npm test
# OR
$ npm watch
```
